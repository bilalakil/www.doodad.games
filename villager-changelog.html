      </ul>

    <h3>v0.2.7</h3>

    <small>

      <h4>New Item Buying System</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>You can now buy items of a specific rarity, starting at 30/90/270/810 gold</li>
        <li>Each time you buy an item, the buy price for that rarity increases in an exponential manner</li>
        <li>
          Each time you sell an item, as well as receiving gold for selling it, it partially reverses the exponential price increase for buying an item of the same rarity
          <ul>
            <li>Specifically, selling an item reverses 0.4 of the purchase of an item
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>New/Reworked Features</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>
          (UI) You can opt in (in the menu) to skip confirmation for some game features:
          <ul>
            <li>Giving an item to a hero</li>
            <li>Giving juice to a hero</li>
            <li>Selecting a target for a hero ability (like Forge)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>(UI) You can now drag items down from the inventory to sell them quickly</li>
        <li>(UI) If you drag an item from one hero to another with a full inventory, a swap button will appear on the destination hero's item popups</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Balance Changes</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>Base item find chance reduced from 0.25% to 0.225%</li>
        <li>Item sell amounts increased to 10/30/90/270 gold</li> 
      </ul>

      <h4>Bug Fixes</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>You can no longer place heroes that you can't afford (not sure when this started happening)</li>
        <li>Treasure and Cache monster abilities now respect their item rarity guarantees</li>
        <li>Aura items effectiveness is now based on the level of the item holder, instead of the affected heroes</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Technical/Other Changes</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>3D model weapons have been scaled up almost across the board</li>
        <li>Projectiles have been scaled up almost across the board</li>
        <li>3D animations have been tweaked and elongated to be more visible</li>
        <li>Floating text is now aggregated where applicable - for instance when killing more than one monster at once</li>
        <li>
          Many, many foundational code changes:
          <ul>
            <li>Moved most gameplay formula calculations (i.e. cooldowns, damage amounts, etc.) into one place so they can be maintained with more consistency</li>
            <li>Reworked the code behind all heroes to make them compatible with a loading system (at the moment all heroes are loaded all the time, which isn't scalable)</li>
            <li>
              Reworked all hero abilities to utilise a new, separate targeting and target validity system, needed to support:
              <ul>
                <li>effects (i.e. from items) that share or depend on a hero's target; and</li>
                <li>changing of targets mid-animation for attacks/spells, which became necessary with the newly elongated animations</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Slowly switching to Unity's improved TextMeshPro for text display</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
